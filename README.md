# PowerPoint Timer add-ins

This plugin for PowerPoint allows to add a timer on a slide. 
This project has been inspired a lot by [this project](https://github.com/robibobi/powerpoint-timer) by Robibobi

I have just added a couple of features:

* Automatically add	an animation so that the timer does not start when the slide is loaded, but upon a click
* Colors changing based on the timer remaining
* Blinking animation once time is up
